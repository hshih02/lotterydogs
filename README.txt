1. If you had an extra month:

The main thing I would implement for, the first assignment, outside of basic 
styling, is better input handling. Rather than have everything separated by
spaces in a single text box, it would be easier to have multiple textboxes,
each limited to a max of 2 digits. A visual indicator for incorrect feedback
would also be great, something along the lines of the text boxes being 
highlighted with a red border if the input values are invalid. 

Style wise it would be better to display all the numbers side by side,
perhaps display each on a ball graphic, and add some visual differences to 
distinguish the lucky ball (like a different colored ball).


2. The thing I like best about Javascript is:

String and input handling. Being able to parse, concatenate, and even run NaN 
analysis on inputs is a godsend coming from lower level languages like 
C and C++.
